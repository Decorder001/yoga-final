                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Welcome to <strong>Journey Within Yoga</strong>, where the focus is on stretching not just the body, but the limits of your soul. My name is <strong>Harish Suthar</strong>, and my yoga journey began at the age of 13 in a small village in Punjab. What started as a school activity has now become a lifelong passion, helping me overcome personal challenges and inspiring me to guide others on their own yoga journey.</p>

                    <p>By the age of 16, I had already participated in multiple yoga competitions, winning <strong>37 certificates, 7 medals, and 8 trophies</strong> at state, district, and national levels. I was also honored with a bronze medal at a national yoga competition held in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh.</p>

                    <p>After a brief break due to health issues during the COVID-19 lockdown, I realized how essential yoga was not only for physical fitness but for holistic well-being. This realization led me to resume my practice and inspired me to create this platform, <strong>Journey Within Yoga</strong>, to share the transformative power of yoga with others.</p>

            <h3>Why "Journey Within"?</h3>
            <p>The name <strong>Journey Within Yoga</strong> reflects my belief that yoga is not just about physical postures, but about looking inward and understanding ourselves better. It's a path to connect with your inner self, cultivate mindfulness, and discover peace in both your body and mind.</p>

            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>My mission is to make yoga accessible and approachable for everyone, regardless of age or experience level. Whether you're seeking flexibility, strength, stress relief, or spiritual growth, I hope to help you find balance through the art of yoga.</p>
            
            <h3>Join the Journey</h3>
            <p>Join me on this journey of self-discovery, growth, and inner peace. Let's stretch, breathe, and journey within together.</p>
